## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly take on the classic **Space Invader** game. It features spaceships, alien enemies, scoring, high score management, and a simple game loop. I've also integrated animations for celebratory effects when the game ends and added the ability to select spaceships from a menu.

The game is split into multiple files for clarity and structure, making it easier to understand the flow of the game. It's designed with simplicity in mind but leaves room for more advanced features in the future.
